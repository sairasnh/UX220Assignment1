## Travel Adventures
- **Bucket List Destinations**: Over the past five years, I've been fortunate to cross several destinations off my travel bucket list, including exploring the historic streets of Kyoto, Japan, and basking in the beauty of the Amalfi Coast in Italy.
- **Cultural Immersion**: My goal was to immerse myself in various cultures, and I achieved this by learning conversational Spanish during a month-long trip through South America and participating in traditional cooking classes in Thailand.
- **Adventure Sports**: I pushed my boundaries by trying adventure sports like skydiving in New Zealand and scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef. These experiences have enriched my life in unexpected ways.
